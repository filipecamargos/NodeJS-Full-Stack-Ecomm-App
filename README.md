# NodeJS-Full-Stack-Ecomm-App
This is a Nodejs e-commerce application. It applies the principle of user authentication, database connection with CRUD operations.
It allows the admin to post products they want to sell, edit it, delete it. It has a shopping section where the shopping users can see products, add them to the cart and iterate through them. It has a really nice user interface and all the end points behave as spected.
